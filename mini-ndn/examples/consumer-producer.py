This example demonstrates a basic consumer-producer using Mini-NDN. It uses ndnpeek and ndnpoke as
a consumer and a producer respectively. If you want to build your own consumer/producer program, you
can take help from here: https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx/tree/master/examples and
here: https://github.com/dulalsaurab/multicast-supression-ndn/tree/main/ndn-src/consumer-producer
