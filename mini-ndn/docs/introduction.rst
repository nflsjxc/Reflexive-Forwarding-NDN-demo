What is Mini-NDN?
-----------------

Mini-NDN is a lightweight networking emulation tool that enables testing, experimentation, and
research on the NDN platform. It was initially based on `Mini-CCNx <https://github.com/chesteve/mn-ccnx>`_ which was a fork of `Mininet <https://github.com/mininet/mininet>`_. Mini-NDN uses the NDN libraries, NFD, NLSR, and tools released by the `NDN project <http://named-data.net/codebase/platform/>`_ to emulate an NDN network on a single system.

The first release of Mini-NDN is developed by members of the NSF-sponsored NDN project team.
Mini-NDN is open to contribution from the public.
